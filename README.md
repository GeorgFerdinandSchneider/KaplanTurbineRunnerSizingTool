# Welcome

This repository hosts a script to seize Kaplan turbine runners. This script implements the sizing methodology as presented by Abeykoon & Hantsch [[1]](https://doi.org/10.11159/htff17.151), which is an adaption of the method presented in [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-8351-9035-1).

# Getting Started

For getting started right away I recommend launch [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GeorgFerdinandSchneider/KaplanTurbineRunnerSizingTool/main?filepath=script.ipynb), which allows you to use and edit the script from your browser in a few seconds.

The calculation script can also be statically inspected in your browser [script.ipynb](script.ipynb).

If you intend to edit the script, I recommend running it on your local machine. This involves setting up python on you local machine with the dependencies as stated in [environment.yml](environment.yml) file. For this purpose I recommend using [Anaconda environment management](https://www.anaconda.com/).
